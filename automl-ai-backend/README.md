- 📊 EDA: Correlation, skewness, class balance
- 🧬 Transformation: Encoding, Scaling, SMOTE
- 🤖 Train: Logistic, RF, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, etc.
- 📈 Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
- 📄 Export: PDF Report & IPYNB Notebook
- 💡 Groq AI Assistant: Insightful suggestions at each step
<!-- - 🔍 SHAP-based model explainability and feature importance -->
- 🧠 UUID-based anonymous usage (no login required)
<!-- - 🔐 Optional login via Supabase Auth
- 🧾 Logged-in users get full session history and resume support -->

## 🛠 Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ro-rok/automl-ai.git
cd automl-ai-backend
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net
MONGODB_DB=automl_ai
MONGODB_COLLECTION=ml_jobs
```

## 📬 MongoDB Integration

- Stores session job metadata with pipeline configs, model, and evaluation metrics.
- Collection: `ml_jobs` (fields: `id`, `user_id`, `filename`, `pipeline`, `model`, `metrics`, timestamps).
- Configure via `MONGODB_URI`, `MONGODB_DB`, and `MONGODB_COLLECTION` env vars.
